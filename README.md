Q: Are you using Vanilla Javascript?
A: ...ish
Javascript code snippets organized in an OOP structure, including:

* Type-safety and type-casting - assisting developers in overcoming issues related to loose typing via Vanilla Javascript (rather than syntactic sugar à la TypeScript)
* OOP features - partial class definitions with shared private members and multiple inheritance
* Strong typing of function signatures along with support for dynamic polymorphism/function overloading
* Dependency injection
* Object traversal, extension and querying features
* Custom events
* Data interpolation - CSV, XML, Punycode and POJO parsing
* Additional Types - Enumerations, GUID
* Large/small number support
* Support back to IE8, with most features supported back to IE6
* Growing unit test coverage with Chai.Assert
* Isomorphic - client- and server-side code in one codebase.

with all non-UI features available both client-side (in-browser) and server-side (Node/etc.).

All features are organized in individually includable mixins organized by namespace/major features with only the core ish.js functionality required to bootstrap.
